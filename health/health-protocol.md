# Health Protocol

__Last updated: September 2019__

This protocol has been based on 15+ blood samples and functional tests I've took across 2017–2019 years. I believe the food part benefits most people, while supplement part is tailored towards my body, so re-evaluate for yourself. 


The main idea behind the protocol is to reduce glucose/insulin spikes while getting the wide range of nutritents. 

As in everything: the chronic is bad. Low glucose levels _all the time_ I believe is chronic. The nature in the wild _sometimes_ (1-3 times a month, not every 2 hours like we eat sugars) supplies lots of sugars at once (found lucky honey/fruit field spot!), hence from time to time I practice mimicking this by eating lots of fruit/berries/sugar at once to spike your glucose and insulin to make sure body knows what it is. 98% of the time — the Food Protocol!
