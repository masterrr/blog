This is a review and notes of Henry Hazlitt's "Thinking as a Science".

# Thinking

## Techniques

* Spend specifically allocated time to think about a hard topic. Train the mind on hard questions;

* Writing when thinking helps structure the thought, eliminate leaps; to increase the bandwidth, talk the thoughts and draw them on paper.

### On the impossibility

If the task is impossible to solve, leave it for a day, week, month, year progressively and keep coming back to it until solved. Forcing the mind to crack the problem is similar to creating waves on the sea â€” beautiful birds-thoughts will be gone until it's calmed down. 

### Hard Questions Examples
1. Does the society shape people's characters of people's characters shape the society? 
2. What is the purpose of war? 


# Reading
## Techniques

* If a book presents questions or conclusion at the end of each chapter - start with them. Answer these questions using your own thinking, then go on to read the chapter and see if you've been correct and how presented information correlates with what you thought. 

* In the middle of the thought in the book, stop reading and try to guess what's the author is going to say next. Anticipate and see if you are right. 


## Picks

* No good book is going to offset bad books. Like with food: no nutritious food is going to offset junk you've eaten. You've eaten it, there is no way back. Pick carefully. 

* What a waste of time is when no understanding is made on every thought written by the author by labeling such a thorough activity as a "waste of time".


# Writing
## Techniques 

* Each word we use is just a concept. When I say "phone", today I mean iPhone and in 1980 it would mean landline mechanical phone. Words, their meanings constantly flux in the mind. Imagine how they differ among invidivudals. To convey some thought as precise as possible express it in as many ways as possible.
