Every product created lies on assumptions. They must be true for the product to succeed. This is Step 1. 

Let's imagine the charity app, where one creates events, people join for money and all monies go towards the charity selected. 

Assumptions may look like this: People...
1. Love doing activities with new unknown people
2. Are aware of charities and are ready to donate
3. Are ready to raise for a selected charity
4. Are confident to create their own events 

The next step is each week mark each assumption as True or False. 

Do it for the whole customer population or per each segment (for example, teens vs. adults). 

For example, 3rd assumption may be invalid for teens. 

Detailed, comprehensive product's assumption list with all marked as True consistently as you work on the product is a first stepping stone for the success.
