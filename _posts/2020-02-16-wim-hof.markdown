I've been taking cold showers for a while and "Wim Hof" name was floating around this space. He popularized a breathing method that I tried this morning for the first time and was mindblown by its effects. 

The body was tingling, the body and mind effect felt so similar to cold showers (due to oxygen uptake mechanisms I guess) and much stronger - teeth(!?) and hands tingling like craze. On the second and third rounds, I was able to hold my breath for 3 minutes! 

When I finished in 15 minutes I was laughing as it felt so good. The next thing I did is to write this blog post and send a link to my friends. 

There is a science behind it:

* Oxygen drop, EPO + HIF (Hypoxia Iducible Factor) - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfyDTcuX0SE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfyDTcuX0SE)

Guiding videos on how do it:

* Entry tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzCaZQqAs9I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzCaZQqAs9I)

I'm incorporating this into my routine along with the cold showers. Nootropic indeed. 

Try it now, and make sure your stomach is empty! Let me know how it goes in comments or email, would love to discuss effects.
