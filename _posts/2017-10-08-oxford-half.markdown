It's been exactly a year since I raced half-marathon in Kyiv (October 9, 2016) and now here I am, racing in Oxford, UK 🇬🇧

### Preparation

💊 My preparation started when I got seriously ill just 2 weeks before the race (38ºC) and recovered only 4 days before, sabotaging my tampering schedule. I'm happy I was healthy on the race day though.

🚄 Two weeks before the race day I checked train timetable for Sunday and there was a solid trains flow from London Marylebone to Oxford. I could have bought tickets on spot but I decided to do it in a few days before the race, in case the race gets canceled and other reasons.

🚖 One day before the race I found out there are *no tickets* available from the start of the day until 10 am. Race starts 9:30 am. Buses were packed too so I made a swift decision to get an Uber!

Best decision I made, right from the home to the start line in 1 hour!

### Running 🏃

Some running sections went along private-owned houses and cottages. People went out and cheered, some shouted 'welcome' and such. Kids were holding trays with gummi bears (jelly beans). Water/energy drink stations were well-organized too.

*Complaining part:* It was my first race when after finish line I experienced runners mass just standing there, blocked by poor swag station throughpout. Not able to move even 1 meter around is not the best experience when your heart is revved up to 18OBPM. Solution? Run faster than 90% and experience no medals queueing 😉

### Result 💨

I'm happy with my result. I finished in 2:08:06, improving my last half Kyiv race time by 3:34 minutes.

### Post-action chill 😛

That's my big veggie pizza I enjoy while people stuck in a long queue to pick-up their running sacks, followed by nice walk around Oxford and train ride back.

### Goals?

I wonder where my October 7, 2017, run will be? 😀

I'm sure I will be to shave these 8 minutes off in a year anyway.

### Cheers!
