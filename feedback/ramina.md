One word: recommended. Ramina is a great stylist and personality. She professionally matched my style up to my needs, desires and event dress-code. 

We went to a boutique in central London where she handled all exchanges with staff and helped me go through options to pick the best one. Ramina explained well why item A should be matched with item B and under what circumstances which allowed me to shape my own requests to her much better. 

I was in a little hurry when we were finishing up and I had yet to buy socks to match my style, Ramina blazingly fast solved this by going on their own to nearby shop and buying items I had to buy while I was finishing up with shoes.  

I did and I will contact her when I need more style in my life.
